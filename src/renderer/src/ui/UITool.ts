// should have "global" settings and "viewport" settings.
// - viewport settings: one for each viewport
// - global settings: apply to all viewport instances.

// i didn't realize this was going to open a can of worms.
//
// creating a new tool should create one instance of the tool.
// (because there is at least an option for a global state with global settings)
// that one instance should allow you to create multiple viewport states
// where each viewport state can be created and destroyed, and has
// access to the global state object.
