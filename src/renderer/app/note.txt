everything in this directory contains a default export which is a global variable,
and can be accessed from anywhere inside the app, indiscriminately.

most other things are accessible somewhere inside the global variable "app".
But, for example, you are also allowed to call dialogs from anywhere, without
having to go through the "app" variable.
